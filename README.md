Continuous Propagation Detection

This Python code aims to detect continuous propagation patterns based on computer vision, mathematical theorems and spatial principles. The detection is achieved by ensuring that velocity field obtain from Optical Flow methods fulfills the divergence theorem. Later, by applying graph theory methods in addition to uniformly continuous demands, one obtains a map of normalized Waveness score.
