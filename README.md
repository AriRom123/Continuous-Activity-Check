Continuous Propagation Detection

This Python code aims to detect continuous propagation patterns based on computer vision, mathematical theorems and spatial principles. The detection is achieved by ensuring that velocity field obtain from Optical Flow methods fulfills the divergence theorem. Later, by applying graph theory methods in addition to uniformly continuous demands, one obtains a map of normalized Waveness score.



HOW TO USE:
1. Download the 'Continuous-Activity-Check repository folder
2. Make sure all imports are installed
3. At the end of the code , one can choose data type from the options: 1 Gaussian , 2 Gaussians, Radial Wave , Plane wave and continuous propagation 
(The project is not published yet, hence no Widefield CA imaging video can be supplied)
4. Choose algorithm parameters as explained in the code


NOTE:
- One can analyze any mp4 / avi file by choosing 'video' as file type and fill path file (In this version only 'square' NxN videos can be analyzed)
- The Output contains for axis: Original video + velocity vectors
                                Algorithm output before graph analysis
                                Waveness map indicating the normalized waveness parameter in addition to average direction (indicated by colors according to the colormap)
                                Distribution of waveness score in the map
