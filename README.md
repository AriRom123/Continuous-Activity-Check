#Continuous Propagation Detection
This Python code aims to detect continuous propagation based on the first principles of propagation, leveraging the concept of the divergence theorem and graph theory techniques. The detection is achieved by ensuring that a continuous mass fulfills the divergence theorem and applying graph theory methods in conjunction with uniformly continuous demands.

Methodology
1. Divergence Theorem
The divergence theorem, also known as Gauss's theorem, states that the outward flux of a vector field through a closed surface is equal to the volume integral of the divergence of the field over the region inside the surface. In the context of continuous propagation detection, this principle is applied to ensure that a continuous mass maintains a consistent flux across its boundaries.

2. Graph Theory Techniques
Graph theory is utilized to represent the network of propagation and analyze its properties. The following techniques are employed:

Graph Representation: The propagation network is represented as a graph, where nodes represent distinct entities (e.g., nodes of propagation) and edges represent connections or relationships between these entities.

Uniformly Continuous Demands: The concept of uniformly continuous demands is applied to ensure that the demands for propagation remain consistent throughout the network. This helps maintain the continuity of propagation without abrupt changes or disruptions.

Graph Analysis: Various graph analysis algorithms and methods are employed to detect patterns of continuous propagation within the network. This includes algorithms for identifying connected components, analyzing flow dynamics, and detecting anomalies or discontinuities in the propagation process.
